1.we have creatted a complier using flex and bison.
 2.I have made 2 file lex and yacc. we have defined token in the lex which we are passing using yylex to yacc which we generally use in c language. yacc parses the sample.cu and prints all the terminals in parse.txt.In yacc it detects variables,constants,function calls,arguments, function body etc.
3.Our commpiler works fine for c code such as those which are given in example of lab.some of the warnings can be neglected.
4. my grammar detects the genereal c language pattern and prints the section of grammar matched.
